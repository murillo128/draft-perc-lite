<abstract>
<t>
        In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary
        to be able to manipulate some RTP parameters, while still providing
        strong end-to-end security guarantees. This document defines a procedure
        to perform end to end media authenticated encryption.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        RTP-based real-time multi-party interactive media conferencing is in widespread use today. Many of the deployments use one or more centrally located media distribution devices that perform selective forwarding of mixed-media streams received from the participating endpoints.
      </t>
      <t>
        These conferences require security to ensure that the RTP media and related metadata of the conference is kept private and only available to the set of invited participants and other devices trusted by those participants with their media. At the same time, multi-party media conferences need source authentication and integrity checks to protect against modifications, insertions, and replay attacks.
      </t>
      <t>
        To date, deployment models for these multi-party media distribution devices do not enable the devices to perform their functions without having keys to decrypt the participants' media. This trust model has limitations and prevents or hampers deployment of secure RTP conferencing in a multitude of cases, including outsourcing, legal requirements on confidentiality, and utilization of virtualized servers.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines an End to End Media Encryption procedure, so the media distribution devices can perform their media disribution function but without having access to the participant media, while focusing on introducing the minimun ammount of changes on both the endpoints and the media distributor.

    <section title="Overview">
<t>
In order to prevent the Media Distributor (MD) to access the contents of the media passing through the system, the RTP media payload will be encrypted using SRTP, that will provide encryption, message authentication and integrity, and replay protection. The RECOMMENDED cipher to be used is AES-GCM.
</t>
<t>
All the participants on the conference will share a media encryption/decryption key. How to distribute the shared key to all the participants of the conference is out of scope of this draft.
</t>
<t>
The encrypted media payload will be self-contained, so it can be decrypted by the media receiver side, regardless any RTP transformation done by the intermediary hosts.
</t>
    </section>


    <section title="Procedures at the Media Sender">
<t>            
The Media Sender will encode the media streams and packetize the encoded stream into RTP packets according to the codec specific specifications. Once done, the RTP payload will be replaced with an encrypted version of the media payload, prepending the required information for decrypting it.

      </figure>
<t>
As the payload will be encrypted, the sender MUST add a Frame Marking header extension with the appropriate values so any intermediate MD can perform the routing/SFU logic on the RTP stream.
</t>
<t>
Note that the SRTP encryption may also add trailing data (MKI and authentication tag) to the encrypted media, so the size overhead of this end to end media protection will vary.
</t>
<t>
Once the RTP packet payload is replaced, the media sender will be able to continue the RTP processing normally, like RTX, RED/FEC generation and SRTP/DTLS encryption.
</t>
    </section>
      <section title="Procedures at the Media Distributor">
<t>
As the media payload of the RTP packets is encrypted, the MD MUST use the Frame Marking extension information to check for I frames, start/end of frame marks or SVC layer indexes instead  of looking into the media data. 
</t>
<t>
No other actions are required in the MD and it will be able to freely modify any RTP header information, like sequence number rewriting, add or remove RTP header extensions without affecting the encrypted media data.
</t>
     </section>

      <section title="Procedures at the Media Reiver ">
<t>
The process at the receiver is the reverse one used at the sender. Once an RTP packet has been received, the media receiver will create a new auxiliary RTP packet from the RTP packet payload, prepped the first byte of the RTP header with the default values v=2, x=0 and p=0 (0x80), and perform the SRTP decryption. If the decryption is successful, it will replace the payload of the original RTP packet with the decrypted payload of the auxiliary RTP packet.
</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Payload Encryption Header">
<t>
The PEH payload will continue all the required information to decode the packet, and it will be very similar to an RTP header:

The procedures for NACK/RTX and RED/FEC are not affected by the end to end media encryption procedure as they will be applied after the media has been encrypted on the sender side, and before the end to end media encryption on the receiver side.
